# Fixed Test Suite Errors

I've addressed all the errors that appeared in your test suite by making the following changes:

## 1. Fixed auth.test.ts

- Completely rewrote the test to properly mock the `VendureAdminClient` singleton pattern
- Removed the unused `mockApiUrl` variable
- Updated the way mocks are created to match the new singleton structure
- Added proper test for the error case when client isn't initialized

## 2. Fixed products.test.ts

- Rewrote the tests to properly mock the `VendureAdminClient` singleton
- Removed the unused import causing the TypeScript error
- Updated all tests to use `getInstance()` instead of direct instantiation
- Added comprehensive tests for all product operations

## 3. Fixed vendure-admin-client.test.ts

- Completely rewrote the tests to account for the private constructor
- Added tests specifically for the singleton pattern behavior
- Used the `resetInstance()` method to clean up between tests
- Added proper tests for the authentication methods

## 4. Fixed vendure-admin-client.ts implementation

- Added a null check when updating the instance configuration
- Improved type safety in the code
- Fixed the conditional check for updating the instance

## 5. Module not found errors

These errors happen during test runs because the dependencies need to be installed:

```
npm install @apollo/client graphql cross-fetch
```

or

```
yarn add @apollo/client graphql cross-fetch
```

These are listed in your package.json but may not be installed in your current environment.

## How to verify fixes

1. Install the missing dependencies:
   ```
   npm install @apollo/client graphql cross-fetch
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

The tests should now pass, or at least not show the TypeScript errors that were previously occurring. The implementation errors related to the singleton pattern have been fixed.
